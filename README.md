## E-Commerce Clothing Store Application [https://e-commerce-clothing-store.netlify.app]

### This is an e-commerce website for selling clothing for which I have used the following:

### - _React_
### - _Redux_
### - _Logging Middleware_
### - _Styled Components_ 
### - _Firebase Authentication_
### - _Firebase Firestore Database_

### I have also used a Service Worker to make the app a PWA (Progressive Web App), which can be accessed offline
